# NLP-Twitter-Spam-Detection

Disaster Tweet Classification Project Summary
- In this project, I explored and implemented three distinct machine learning frameworks—Keras, PyTorch, and Random Forest Classifier—to enhance the accuracy and optimize the performance of our models. The primary goal was to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which are not.

Methodologies Employed:
- Keras: Utilized Keras to construct and train our machine learning models, leveraging its functionalities and abstractions.
The final model was enhanced with GloVe embeddings and pre-trained word embeddings, achieving an accuracy of 80%.

- PyTorch: PyTorch was employed as an alternative approach to model development, offering flexibility and dynamic computational graphs.
This framework helped in fine-tuning and experimenting with various neural network architectures to optimize performance.

- Random Forest Classifier: This method was used to provide a traditional machine learning approach, offering a comparative analysis against deep learning models.Random Forest Classifier's robustness and interpretability added value to our model comparison and overall understanding of feature importance.
